Convert Windows Cursors to Linux


I've found the Ubuntu Cursors which were unlike the name, designed for Windows. 
But I wanted to use them on a Linux machine, so I created this tool.

Not all cursors do work, I did not found out the correct name so Linux would recognize them. But if you know, please tell me ;)
